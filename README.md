Some solutions in C++ to problems appearing on [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/problemset/).

When I first started this, I inexplicably wrote super-verbose and completely-commented code.
Coming back two years later, I have realised that isn't the best way to be solving contest
problems that are intended to be done under timed conditions.

So the newer solutions are distinctly less readable. That's fine, I guess.
